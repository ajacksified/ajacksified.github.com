    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    I'm Jack Lawson, a software engineer at
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>. I've worked in many different
    languages and parts of the stack, although I specialize in front-end
    developmernt. I believe strongly in building <em>good</em> software that
    optimizes efficiency for developers in order to make it easier to delight
    users. My core belief, and what inspires me, is that <strong>the greatest
    tragedy is the loss of creative potential</strong>, which means my mission
    is to help people to create things. Everybody is, at some
    level, with some medium, a creator of things; everybody has a unique
    viewpoint and life experience that allows them to produce something
    special. My skill is software engineering.

    I've been programming since I was 11. I've worked in
    BASIC, html, JavaScript, CSS, ASP, TI-BASIC, PHP, ColdFusion, C#, bash, vimscript,
    Python, Scheme, Ruby, Node, Coffeescript, Lua, Moonscript, and Clojure.
    I'm most familar with the client-side stack, and of these langauges hold Lua
    and Node as my strongest, although lately I've been working a fair amount in
    Ruby and Python. I've recently started learning Clojure. I run the Lua meetup
    group for the San Francisco Bay Area, and I've spoken at a few events such as
    <a href="http://html5devconf.com/archives/october2012/index.html">html5devconf</a>
    and <a href="https://waza.heroku.com/2013">Waza</a>.

    My core technolgical philosophies are based in using the right tool, and not
    surrendering to the seduction of short-term convenience. Concretely, this
    genreally involves RESTful APIs, pragmatic TDD, and uncompromising
    progressive enhancement. I belive in open-sourcing all generic (read:
    non-business-logicky) components, because a rising tide lifts all boats.

    My most interesting work is on
    <a href="https://www.github.com/ajacksified">my github account</a> and my
    <a href="https://www.github.com/Olivine-Labs">Olivine Labs</a> LLC, where I
    collaborate with other friends on open-source projects and online games.
