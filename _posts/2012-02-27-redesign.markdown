So a little while ago I wrote about ditching bootstrap, at which point I did
a very slight redesign of the blog; I recently ditched a grid system and folded
a reset stylesheet as part of a new blog redesign. I previously put about
twenty minutes of work into my last design; this one got at least thirty. I
like the bolder reds.
