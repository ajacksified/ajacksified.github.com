About two months ago, I wrote about [ditching Twitter Bootstrap](/2012/01/ditching-twitter-bootstrap/index.html).
I had put up a temporary design that was, more or less, a clone of my existing
Bootstrap site; brown instead of black and white, but more or less the same.
I've decided to revisit some of my decisions, such as the use of a grid system
and roughly applied CSS and remove some of the unnecessary stuff.

This new design, then, has much less complexity; it sticks with a very limited
palette and uses typography better to set the feel of the site.
