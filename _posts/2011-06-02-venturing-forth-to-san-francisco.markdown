Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.pillartechnology.com/">Pillar 
Technology</a>. I had an awesome time learning from the great people I worked 
with:

* Tim Wingfield ([@timwingfield](http://twitter.com/#!/timwingfield))
* Michael Kramer ([@michaelkramer](http://twitter.com/#!/michaelkramer))
* Rebecca Denning ([@rebeccadenning](http://twitter.com/#!/RebeccaDenning))
* Todd Kauffman ([@toddkauffman](http://twitter.com/#!/toddkauffman))
* Phil Jordan ([@philipjordan](http://twitter.com/#!/philipjordan))
* Tyler Wymer ([@twymer](http://www.twitter.com/twymer)

I learned an incredible amount of time in the short time I was there, 
especially about Agile practices, TDD, proper spiraling of footballs, to blame 
Phil for everything, to embrace new technologies- even Apple, and how to 
pronounce "facade". That's "fuh-cade" with a long "a" and a hard "c". I've 
begun using vim for everything, I learned how to use Git, and I've picked up 
ReSharper and a finer understanding of development productivity.

I also, in turn, hope that I leave the team with a finer method of brewing 
coffee (fill the filter to the top, use fresh water, wash out the pot every 
time.) The proper times to do this are 9:15, 10:45, and 2:30.

As I move forward in my career to San Francisco, I'll look back upon this time 
and the knowledge and experienceI've gained, and I hope to retain these 
relationships.

And I'll continue to blame Phil.
