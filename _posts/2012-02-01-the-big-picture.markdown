I had written [a post](http://thejacklawson.com/2011/12/HTML/index.html) a
couple months ago, stressing the importance of semantic HTML. I feel good about
that article, but I had originally meant to write more about the importance of
progressive enhancement. Today, while I was reading an article by Bruce Lawson
where he [posted a list of interesting articles](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2012/reading-list-mobile-development-approaches/)
as he is wont to do, the last article really grabbed my attention. It opened
with:

> It seems to me that we are slowly switching from publishing content for the
> Web, to making content accessible to Screen-Readers (SR) - from targeting
> users, to focusing on devices and modern browsers.

One thousand times yes. We seem to be in the *exact same* prediciment that
caused the stagnated IE: we're targetting "Webkit only", for example,
when we should be building progressively enhanced websites that work
with everything, and adding on the fanciness to newer browsers. Take a note
here, before sending out the pitchforks and torches: "work with everything"
doesn't mean the same thing as "the same in every browser, so you have to
try to hack in gradients and rounded corners in IE5.5".  I highly suggest 
that you [read it here](http://www.css-101.org/articles/the_power_of_the_web_is_in_its_universality/strive_to_make_content_accessible_to_all.php).

Don't make the mistakes of the past.
