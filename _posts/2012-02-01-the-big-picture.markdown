I had written [a post](/2011/12/HTML/index.html) a
couple months ago, stressing the importance of semantic HTML. I feel good about
that article, but I had originally meant to write more about the importance of
progressive enhancement. Today, while I was reading an article by Bruce Lawson
where he [posted a list of interesting articles](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2012/reading-list-mobile-development-approaches/)
as he is wont to do, the last article really grabbed my attention. It opened
with:

We seem to be in the *exact same* prediciment that
caused the stagnated IE: we're targetting specific browers, even when we have
the tools, knowledge, and more importantly foresight to be better than this.
To be better than building "Webkit only" sites. I highly suggest 
that you [read it here](http://www.css-101.org/articles/the_power_of_the_web_is_in_its_universality/strive_to_make_content_accessible_to_all.php).

If you want to find out more about progressive enhancement, check out

Don't make the mistakes of the past.
