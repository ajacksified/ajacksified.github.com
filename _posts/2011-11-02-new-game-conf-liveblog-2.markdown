This is a live blog for the second official day of 
[New Game Conference](http://www.newgameconf.com). I'll keep quick notes during
the presentations, and clean up grammar / confusing structures during breaks.
The Q &amp; A sections are paraphrased. Any quotes will be signified as such. 
Please leave corrections and requests for clarification in the comments here.

Also check out #ngc11 and #bbg on irc.freenode.net

I've used images that people post to Twitter; *none of them are mine*. I've used
small versions of the images and linked to the original posting.

##Keynote by Paul Bakaus
