This is a live blog for the second official day of 
[New Game Conference](http://www.newgameconf.com). I'll keep quick notes during
the presentations, and clean up grammar / confusing structures during breaks.
The Q &amp; A sections are paraphrased. Any quotes will be signified as such. 
Please leave corrections and requests for clarification in the comments here.

Also check out #ngc11 and #bbg on irc.freenode.net

I've used images that people post to Twitter; *none of them are mine*. I've used
small versions of the images and linked to the original posting.

## Notes on Chromebooks
Non-US residents will pick up physical devices. US residents will receive
vouchers to order Chromebooks, which will be shipped to your house.

##Keynote by Paul Bakaus
*Nov 1, 9:00 - 9:45*

CEO of Zynga Germany, creator of jQuery UI, creator of Aves Engine; heads
html5 initiatives in Zynga.

Zynga is the world's leading social develop; 232M monthly active users. Played
in over 166 countries in 17 languages.

Paul started because there were no html5 game engines; nothing suited his
needs, so he went out to create an engine. 

Problem: game developers are way faster than browser developers.

* html5 audio: no common codecs across browsers, audio playback is restricted
  differently across browsers (some don't have multichannel, some restrict
  what can start sounds to user actions)
* Device apis still missing: camera, file system, etc. Google is working
  towards access with latest version of Android
* Debugging is difficult on mobile; good tools exist on desktop, especially
  webkit's debugger
