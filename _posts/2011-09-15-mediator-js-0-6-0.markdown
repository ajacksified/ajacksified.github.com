Yeah, so, I skipped a version number again. Version 0.5.0 is a pretty hefty 
update, followed by 0.5.1 and 0.6.0 (which are quite a bit smaller.) Here's 
what's new:

0.5.0
-----
* Subscribers are now a real object instead of an anonymous collection of data
* Contain a guid for an id for access later
* Update function that allows you to modify its function, options, or context 
after adding it
* You can change subscriber's priority (as an index with the other subscribers 
within your channel), so if you want one to fire _first_, you can do so either 
as an option on Subscribe or later using Mediator.SetPriority(id/fn, 
&lt;channelname&gt;). Channelname makes this run significantly faster, but is not 
required.

0.6.0
-----
* Channel is returned at the end of the data arguments for callbacks. Within a 
callback function, you can run channel.StopPropagation() to stop further 
subscribers from being notified.

There's probably a significant amount of cleanup left to do on it, but I think 
it's fairly fully-featured, and it's unit tested pretty solidly.

The latest is [up on Github](https://github.com/ajacksified/Mediator.js) with 
an updated readme file that explains how to use everything.
