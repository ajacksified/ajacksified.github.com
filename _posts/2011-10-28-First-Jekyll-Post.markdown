I'm writing this post in vim, using markdown, and in a minute I'm going to
publish it by using "git push" in iTerm. How cool is that?

It took a little work converting my old Wordpress blog over to Jekyll- long
enough that I'll have to save the "how" post and the "why" post until later-
but ultimately satisfying.
