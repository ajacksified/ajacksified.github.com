I gave this presentation at Akamai's Edge conference and NewRelic's FutureStack
(with slight differences); it's about what tools I use to measure the impact of
web performance work I do.

The slides are built in Reveal.js, and are available at
[github.com/ajacksified/performance-tooling](https://github.com/ajacksified/performance-tooling).
