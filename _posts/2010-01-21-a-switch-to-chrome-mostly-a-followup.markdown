A follow-up to my <a href="http://www.thejacklawson.com/index.php/2009/07/a-switch-to-chrome-mostly/"> original post from July</a>, a mere 6 months ago.

I have, now, totally switched to Chrome. And yes, it was exactly for the reason 
I fully expected to: extensions came out. Sort of like Google's this big 
Overmind that watches all...

Then again, I guess it is, isn't it.

Anyway, the performance difference between FireFox and Chrome is clear. In 
direct contrast to one comment left on my original post, I have as many 
extensions in Chrome as I do in FireFox, performing the same activities (with 
one caveat)- and it is noticeablyÂ faster. I load up FF when I do IE: to test 
the differences in rendering engines across browsers, so that I can fix the CSS 
and Javascript bugs. To be fair, FF has the best debugging (that version of 
FireBug is far superior to anything I've seen yet), which makes testing so much 
easier. But, FF is on my machine only for that. For debugging. Not for browsing.

Honestly, I see absolutely no compelling reasons to use anything but Chrome; 
it's what I install on all of my relative's computers, and it's what I use 
every day at work and home.

All hail the Overmind!
