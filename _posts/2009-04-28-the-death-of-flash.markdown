I'm _excited_. Not because a technology is dying, necessarily, but because 
something far, far better has risen in it's place. Because now I, as a 
developer, can use a language (no, <a class="zem_slink" title="ActionScript" 
rel="wikipedia" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript">ActionScript</a> is not a 
language, at least in my book) that works for rapid development, that leverages 
my existing knowledge of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" 
rel="wikipedia" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and that 
users won't have to use a plugin for.

<a class="zem_slink" title="Adobe Flash" rel="wikipedia" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> is dead, long live <a 
class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" rel="homepage" 
href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.

I've recently been playing around on a few pseudo-projects, where I've just 
done as much "flashy" stuff as I can (Maybe I'll update these later if I ever 
have anything finished.) So far, I've had things fade in, things move, things 
flash, things animate to different colors, things change when they're focused 
on, or moused over, or clicked on... almost everything anyone used flash for in 
the past, I've been able to replicate. The only thing I haven't tried so far is 
embedding multimedia (I have used a sound plugin that works beautifully, 
though.) And all of this with a few lines of code, no compiling.. and only a 
19kb download.

Almost everything I've ever wanted to do with jQuery already exists in a 
plugin. Everything else was either a tweak of another plugin, or something I 
built myself, and always under 20 lines of code. Make that happen with 
Actionscript.

I guess what I'm saying is: jQuery is easier for the developer to develop, and 
it's easier for the client computer to run (no plugins, faster, direct dom 
manipulation). So, why is anyone still using Flash?
