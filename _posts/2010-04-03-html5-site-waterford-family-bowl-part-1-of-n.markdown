A little while ago, my aunt approached me- she needed a website for her bowling 
alley. "Sure," I said. "Let's go over what you want and we'll build something 
that works for you."  In the back of my mind, I was thinking "awesome! Perfect 
timing to flex my HTML5 muscles and try jQuery 1.4 in a production environment; 
will it work?"

The site's now completed, and in production. Go ahead and check it out at 
[http://www.waterfordfamilybowl.com](http://www.waterfordfamilybowl.com/). I'm going to, over a 
series of 4 or 5 posts, go over how the site works- how and why I used PHP, 
jQuery, HTML 5, jQuery, Wordpress, Picasa, Google Analytics and Webmaster 
tools, and Google Apps; and, how I merged them all to create a dynamic, easy to 
use and easy to edit website. I used principles from books like "The Design of 
Everyday Things" and "Don't Make Me Think", and I'll explain how and where 
these came into play.   The process I took made even IE 6 compatibility a 
breeze!

Brief overview on how I plan to break it down:

1. Intro to series
2. Design - architecturally and graphically
3. Implementation of Wordpress, Picasa, etc.
4. "Contact Us", finishing touches
5. Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools overviews
6. Wrap-up (maybe?)
