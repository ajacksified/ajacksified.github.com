    <p>
      I've recently been doing quite a bit of work with client-side templating,
      and I've really enjoyed working with 
      <a href="http://mustache.github.com">Mustache</a>. As part of Qotr 
      development (which you can read about below), I put together some really 
      basic templates for creating RSS feeds, by passing in simple hashes to
      a Mustache engine.

      Well, besides the fact that my blog is obviously mine, it's an experiment
      with jekyll, markdown, and eventually I'm going to use it as a testbed
      for Coffeescript and SCSS experiments.

    <p>
      Qotr is a site where you can share quotes; inspired by sites such as
      <a href="http://bash.org">bash.org</a> and 
      <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a>, and many companies who keep
      their own internal quote boards on wikis, you can create your own board
      or post to a public board.

    <p>
      Drew Ditthardt and I built Alchemy Websockets, a .NET library that
      helps manage a huge number of websocket connections. Its architecture,
      pushed forward by Drew, allows it to handle multiple thousands of
      simulataneous connections on limited hardware. I helped build the
      interface layer, bugtest, and put together a basic client library
      for web browsers.

      <span class="label warning">Support</span>
    </header>

    <p>
      I built Mediator.js as an easy way to handle pub/sub and eventing in
      javascript. The need originally came up as a way to handle ajax
      callbacks, but its use far outgrew its original intention and
      Mediator.js grew into something far more flexible.
